The original GitHub project [studio-se-master](https://github.com/Talend/studio-se-master.git) is maintained by Talend.

## Features

- Failed to builds:
  - tags/release/7.3.1 at Jan 2021
  - tags/release/7.4.1M6 at Jan 2021

## Getting started

1. Prepare git and bash environment.

    With Linux, you simply install git with your package manager.

    If you are on Windows 10, [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) should be easy because you will maybe use git command later :). For more detail, [SDKMAN! installation page](https://sdkman.io/install) would be help you. And I also recommend [chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/) for beginners.

    ```shell-session
    @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
    choco install -y git zip
    ```

1. Install build tool chain.

    [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) should be easy for all. Because it supports both Windows and Linux environment.

    ```shell-session
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    sdk install java 8.0.282-zulu
    export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
    sdk install maven
    ```

    Note: This sample use a PSU version of OpenJDK 8. Notice that Talend only support a CPU version of it.

    On your Windows 10, [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) would be also better choice.

1. Clone this project with ```--recursive``` option.

    ```shell-session
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/msminek/talend-studio-se-master.git
    ```

    if you miss the ```--recursive``` option at cloning, exec below:

    ```shell-session
    cd talend-studio-se-master
    git submodule update --init
    ```

1. Checkout version.

    ```shell-session
    cd talend-studio-se-master
    ./project-init.sh release/7.3.1
    ```

1. Build Talend Open Studios.

    ```shell-session
    ./build-tos.sh
    ```

    A build logs are output at [the logs folder](logs/).

## ToDo

### Too long file names for the Windows platform

It might be cause something trouble, I doubt. I will build at a linux container for the reason.

## FAQ

### I cannot build the current milestone build(s)

The p2 repository for the milestone build is a Talend private repository. So we cannot build.

### I cannot build the old release version(s)

Sometime we cannot build the old version Talend Open Studio(s).

Especialy v5 or older versions, its source repository was on the subversion. I could not build any Talend Open Studio(s) with the subversion repository.

### Which version can I build ?

That I want to know. When the version 6 I could build with the repositories.

### Where can I found the TOS zip file after build ?

It might be in the build floders something like these:

- studio-se-master/build/talend.studio.tos.bd.product/target/products/
- studio-se-master/build/talend.studio.tos.di.product/target/products/
- studio-se-master/build/talend.studio.tos.dq.product/target/products/
- studio-se-master/build/talend.studio.tos.esb.product/target/products/
